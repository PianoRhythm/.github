## About the Project

PianoRhythm is designed to create a collaborative musical experience where users can:

- **Play music together in real-time** with low-latency synchronization
- **Interact through chat and social features** with typing indicators and user profiles
- **Join or create themed rooms** with customizable environments
- **Participate in casual games** including rhythm games and musical challenges
- **Customize their experience** with multiple themes, 3D/2D rendering modes, and UI preferences
- **Use MIDI devices** for authentic piano playing experience

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: SolidJS with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets, WebRTC
- **UI Components**: Hope UI (custom fork)
- **State Management**: Solid Services, Immer
- **Build System**: Vinxi with custom presets
- **Testing**: Vitest, Solid Testing Library, Cypress

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Bun (production), Node.js (development)
- **Real-time Server**: WebSocket with crossws adapter
- **Database**: MongoDB with Data API
- **API**: REST endpoints with server middleware
- **Authentication**: OAuth (Discord, GitHub) with JWT

### Core Engine
- **Language**: Rust (Nightly toolchain)
- **Integration**: WebAssembly with wasm-bindgen

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Current)
The project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on every push to the main branch:
- **Live Demo**: https://pianorhythm.github.io/pianorhythm-ssr/
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Actions
- **Build**: Static site generation with SSR prerendering

### Production Deployment
For production environments, the application is deployed using:
- **Container Registry**: DigitalOcean Container Registry
- **Runtime**: Bun server with Docker containers
- **CDN**: Custom assets and static content delivery
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas with Data API

## Building

The project uses **Vinxi** with custom presets for different deployment environments:

- **Development**: Hot reload with source maps
- **Staging**: Optimized build with debugging enabled
- **Production**: Fully optimized with prerendering and minification

### Test Coverage
- **Frontend**: Vitest with Solid Testing Library
- **Components**: Snapshot and interaction testing
- **Services**: Mock-based unit testing
- **E2E**: Cypress for full user workflows

### Initialization System Development
When working with the app initialization:
- **Adding new steps**: Follow the dependency-based pattern in `InitializationService`
- **Race condition prevention**: Always use the initialization service for startup operations
- **Testing**: Write tests for new initialization steps using the established patterns
- **Debugging**: Use the comprehensive logging system for troubleshooting startup issues
